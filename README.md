### scala.meta tutorial: Automatic migration for view bounds

### Problem statement

As discussed in [SI-7629](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7629) and implemented in [#2909](https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2909), view bounds are almost ready to be deprecated. There is a consensus that this language feature is unnecessary, there is an understanding of how to replace usages of view bounds, the compiler already supports deprecation warnings for view bounds (under `-Xfuture`).

The only thing that's missing is a migration tool that would automatically rewrite view bounds into equivalent code. In this guide, we are going to write such a tool using functionality provided by scala.meta.

Over the course of the guide, we will be developing and testing our migration tool on an excerpt from the standard library that lives in
[scala/math/Ordering.scala](https://github.com/scala/scala/blob/v2.11.7/src/library/scala/math/Ordering.scala). It is non-trivial enough to make things interesting:

```scala
package scala
package math

import java.util.Comparator
import scala.language.{implicitConversions, higherKinds}

// Skipping some code from scala/math/Ordering.scala

trait LowPriorityOrderingImplicits {
  /** This would conflict with all the nice implicit Orderings
   *  available, but thanks to the magic of prioritized implicits
   *  via subclassing we can make `Ordered[A] => Ordering[A]` only
   *  turn up if nothing else works.  Since `Ordered[A]` extends
   *  `Comparable[A]` anyway, we can throw in some Java interop too.
   */
  implicit def ordered[A <% Comparable[A]]: Ordering[A] = new Ordering[A] {
    def compare(x: A, y: A): Int = x compareTo y
  }
}

// Skipping some more code from scala/math/Ordering.scala
```

### Configuring the build system

In order to configure your build system to pick up scala.meta, you need just a single `libraryDependencies` line. The exact shape of the entry depends on the tasks that you're going to perform:
  * Syntactic operations: `libraryDependencies += "org.scalameta" %% "scalameta" % "..."` (platform-independent data structures/APIs + platform-independent tokenizer and parser)
  * Semantic operations: `libraryDependencies += "org.scalameta" %% "scalahost" % "..."` (the same as above + platform-dependent typechecker implemented on top of scalac)

In our case, we need to do a purely syntactic rewriting, so the first line is going to suffice. Refer to [other guides](https://github.com/scalameta/tutorial/blob/master/README.md#practical-guides) to see how to proceed with semantic APIs.

Despite being one-liners, both scalameta and scalahost actually refer to a bunch of submodules, which means that if necessary you can be really fine-grained about the functionality that you want to include. In our case, it'd be enough to reference `libraryDependencies += "org.scalameta" %% "quasiquotes" % "..."`, but we'll proceed with `"scalameta"` for simplicity.

### Setting up imports

Since scala.meta APIs aren't living in a cake (looking at you, `scala.tools.nsc` and `scala.reflect`), setting up the environment is fairly simple and typically takes just one line of code.

As we've referenced `"scalameta"`, it's enough to just `import scala.meta._` to bring all the functionality into the current scope. When referencing individual modules, the umbrella import is not available, and one has to import individual pieces of functionality separately (e.g. `import scala.meta.parsers._` or `import scala.meta.quasiquotes._`).

```scala
import scala.meta._

object Test {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    ???
  }
}
```
